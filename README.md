- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tushar. 😬 
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much everything. I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades.  
- 🌱 In my free time, I comtemplate completing my side projects. 🤷🏻‍♂️
- 💻 Currently, orchestrating premium instances of Gerrit code review system on Kuberernetes and enabling Datadog in a highly complex Code Distribution system @ Qualcomm.
